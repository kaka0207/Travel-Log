## [Unreleased] - 2026-06-09

### Removed

- Removed Vitest configuration, test helpers, photo procedure tests, and test scripts from the production-clean project.
- Removed stale component-level README content that was no longer part of the active project documentation.

### Documentation

- Rewrote `README.md` as the main project说明文档.
- Rewrote `DEPLOYMENT.md` as the deployment and operations guide.
- Updated `scripts/README.md` to match the currently retained maintenance scripts and Bun commands.

## [2.3.0] - 2025-07-08

### Security

- **S3 upload validation**: Server-side contentType whitelist restricts uploads to image formats only (jpeg, png, webp, heic, heif, avif) and enforces file size limit
- **LIKE injection prevention**: Escape SQL wildcards (`%`, `_`, `\`) in photo search input
- **Visibility enforcement**: Public pages (travel, cities) now only return photos with `visibility: "public"`
- **Protected procedures**: `photos.getOne` and `photos.getMany` restricted to authenticated users

### Added

- **Vitest test framework**: Test setup with mocks for React cache, next/headers, S3 client, and auth session
- **Photo procedure tests**: 16 test cases covering create, update, getOne, getMany, remove and edge cases
- **Environment validation**: Zod-based server env validation — app fails fast with clear errors on missing config
- **`.dockerignore`**: Reduces Docker build context by excluding node_modules, .next, .git, IDE files, etc.

### Changed

- **Database transactions**: `photos.create` and `photos.remove` wrapped in `db.transaction()` for data consistency
- **ctx.db migration**: All tRPC routers now use `ctx.db` instead of direct `db` imports for better testability
- **DB connection pool caching**: Cached on `globalThis` to prevent connection pool leaks during Next.js HMR
- **Docker secrets externalized**: `docker-compose.yml` uses `${VAR:-default}` syntax, overridable via `.env`
- **Error handling**: `photos.remove` re-throws `TRPCError` to preserve original error codes
- **updatedAt timestamps**: Photo updates now correctly refresh the `updatedAt` field
- **Remove procedure cleanup**: Merged duplicated city set update branches, S3 delete moved after DB commit

### Fixed

- Removed unused `select()` query after city set upsert in photo creation
- Removed empty `else` block in photo creation procedure
